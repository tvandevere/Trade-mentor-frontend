# Trade Mentor AI - Landing Page Design

## 1. Overall Goal

To create an informative and engaging public-facing landing page that clearly explains the Trade Mentor AI product, highlights its key benefits and features, encourages users to sign up or log in, and maintains a consistent look and feel with the main application.

## 2. Inspiration & Style

- **Primary Inspiration:** While direct browsing of `tradepath.ai` was not possible, the design will draw from common best practices for SaaS and FinTech landing pages.
- **Look and Feel:** Consistent with the existing Trade Mentor AI application (modern, clean, intuitive, dark-themed, using similar typography, color palette, and UI components where appropriate).

## 3. Page Structure & Sections

### 3.1. Header Navigation (Simplified for Landing Page)

- **Logo:** Trade Mentor AI Logo (left-aligned)
- **Navigation Links (right-aligned):**
    - Features
    - How it Works
    - Pricing (Placeholder - can be added later if applicable)
    - Blog (Placeholder - can be added later if applicable)
- **Primary CTA Button:** "Login / Sign Up" (prominently displayed)

### 3.2. Hero Section

- **Headline:** Compelling and benefit-driven. E.g., "Your AI-Powered Trading Mentor: Master the Markets, Every Step of the Way."
- **Sub-headline:** Elaborates on the headline and core value. E.g., "Get personalized guidance, real-time insights, and comprehensive education to elevate your trading skills with Trade Mentor AI."
- **Visual:** A dynamic and relevant background image or subtle animation related to trading, AI, or financial charts (could be an abstract representation or a stylized screenshot of the app).
- **Primary Call to Action (CTA):** Large button, e.g., "Get Started Free" or "Access Your Dashboard" (if logged in, could change to "Go to App"). This button will link to the login/registration page or directly to the app if the user is already authenticated.
- **Secondary CTA (Optional):** Smaller link or button, e.g., "Learn More" (scrolls to features section) or "Watch Demo" (if a demo video is planned).

### 3.3. "How It Works" / Product Explanation Section

- **Title:** E.g., "Meet MentorBull: Your Personal AI Trading Guide"
- **Brief Overview:** Explain the core concept of Trade Mentor AI – an AI assistant that guides users through their trading day (Pre-Market, Market, Post-Market).
- **Key Steps (Illustrated with icons or simple graphics):**
    1.  **Personalized Pre-Market Prep:** Start your day with AI-driven routines and market overviews tailored to you.
    2.  **Real-Time Market Insights:** Receive AI-generated trade ideas, market commentary, and psychological support while the market is live.
    3.  **Reflective Post-Market Analysis:** Review your trades with MentorBull, get feedback, and receive personalized learning recommendations.

### 3.4. Key Features Section

- **Title:** E.g., "Unlock Your Trading Potential with Powerful Features"
- **Layout:** Use a card-based layout or a grid system to present 3-4 key features.
- **Feature 1: AI-Powered Insights & Trade Ideas**
    - Icon: Brain/AI icon
    - Description: Leverage advanced AI to get actionable trade ideas, market analysis, and sentiment indicators for any security you follow.
- **Feature 2: Comprehensive Trading Day Guidance**
    - Icon: Calendar/Clock icon
    - Description: Seamless support through pre-market planning, in-market execution, and post-market review, simulating a dedicated mentor.
- **Feature 3: Integrated Education Hub**
    - Icon: Book/Graduation Cap icon
    - Description: Access a curated library of educational content, from beginner basics to advanced strategies, recommended by your AI mentor.
- **Feature 4: Community & Performance Tracking (Future-proofed)**
    - Icon: Users/Chart icon
    - Description: (Initially can be a placeholder or focus on individual trade logging) Connect with fellow traders, share insights, and track your performance journey. (Can mention future leaderboard integration here).

### 3.5. Benefits Section

- **Title:** E.g., "Why Choose Trade Mentor AI?"
- **Focus on User Benefits:**
    - **Learn Faster:** Understand market dynamics and trading strategies with personalized AI guidance.
    - **Trade Smarter:** Make more informed decisions with AI-generated insights and real-time support.
    - **Build Confidence:** Develop a disciplined trading approach with a mentor by your side.
    - **Stay Ahead:** Continuous learning and adaptation with an AI that evolves with the market.

### 3.6. Testimonials / Social Proof (Placeholder)

- **Title:** E.g., "What Our Traders Say"
- **Content:** Placeholder for future user testimonials. Can initially be omitted or use a generic statement about user focus.

### 3.7. Call to Action (Reinforced)

- **Headline:** E.g., "Ready to Transform Your Trading?"
- **CTA Button:** Same as Hero section CTA, e.g., "Sign Up Now" or "Login to Your Account".

### 3.8. Footer

- **Copyright:** "© [Current Year] Trade Mentor AI. All Rights Reserved."
- **Links (Optional):**
    - Privacy Policy
    - Terms of Service
    - Contact Us
- **Social Media Icons (Optional)**

## 4. Login/Registration Integration

- The "Login / Sign Up" button in the header and the CTAs in the Hero and final Call to Action sections will link to the existing `/auth/login` and `/auth/register` pages within the application.
- The landing page itself will not contain the login form directly but will serve as the primary gateway to these authentication pages.

## 5. Technical Considerations

- **Responsive Design:** The page must be fully responsive and look great on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Performance:** Optimized for fast loading times.
- **SEO Basics:** Use appropriate headings, meta descriptions, and keywords for discoverability (can be refined later).

This design document provides a solid foundation. I will now proceed to implement a first version of this landing page based on these specifications.
