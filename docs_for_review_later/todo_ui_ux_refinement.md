## UI/UX Refinement To-Do List

- [ ] **Phase 1: Research and Foundation**
    - [ ] Research inspirational UI/UX patterns from tradepath.ai, Webull, and Robinhood, focusing on elements suitable for Trade Mentor AI.
    - [ ] Document key inspirational elements and how they might be adapted.

- [ ] **Phase 2: Landing Page UI/UX Refinement**
    - [ ] Refine the Landing Page UI/UX with detailed descriptions and mock data/visual concepts.
    - [ ] Ensure the design clearly communicates the AI mentor value proposition and proactive nature.

- [ ] **Phase 3: Application Tabs UI/UX Refinement**
    - [ ] Define overall application navigation (bottom menu for app-like feel - user_6).
    - [ ] Define tab order: Pre-Market, Market, Post-Market, Education, Community (incorporating Leaderboard functionality - user_31, user_35).
    - [ ] **For each tab (Pre-Market, Market, Post-Market, Education, Community):**
        - [ ] Detail the UI layout, key components, and visual design.
        - [ ] Describe how mock data will be presented.
        - [ ] Illustrate how the AI Mentor (MentorBull) proactively interacts within the tab feed (user_7, user_8, user_46).
        - [ ] Incorporate the trading day checklist/progress indicator where relevant (user_49).
        - [ ] Specifically for the Market tab: detail chart presentation, AI trade ideas, and trade logging UI.
        - [ ] Specifically for the Community tab: design a simpler X/Twitter-like interface with followers, posts, and integrated Leaderboard elements (user_36, user_35).

- [ ] **Phase 4: AI Mascot and Agent Integration**
    - [ ] Describe the visual appearance of the MentorBull AI mascot (cartoon bull based on logo - user_32, user_33, user_48).
    - [ ] Detail how MentorBull will be visually integrated into the UI (e.g., in feeds, as a small guiding animation - user_48).
    - [ ] Ensure the AI-driven flow and proactive, educational nature of the agent are reflected in the UI/UX descriptions across all relevant sections.

- [ ] **Phase 5: Documentation and Review**
    - [ ] Compile all UI/UX refinement descriptions, mock data examples, and visual concepts into a comprehensive document (`ui_ux_refinement_details.md`).
    - [ ] Ensure the document is written in detailed paragraphs, not lists.
    - [ ] Commit the document and any related assets/code stubs to Git.
    - [ ] Send the `ui_ux_refinement_details.md` to the user for feedback and approval.

- [ ] **Phase 6: Iteration (If Needed)**
    - [ ] Incorporate user feedback into the UI/UX designs.
    - [ ] Update documentation and commit changes.
