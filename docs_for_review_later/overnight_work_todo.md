# Overnight Work Plan - Trade Mentor AI (5 Passes)

This document tracks the progress through 5 passes of the 14-step development plan.

## Pass 1 of 5

- [ ] **001: Verify & Stabilize Backend Connectivity**
  - Status: Pass 1 - Public proxy from sandbox is unreliable (Connection reset by peer). Backend runs locally. User reports external access is working. Will continue to monitor and attempt fixes periodically.
- [x] **002: Implement Frontend-Backend Auth Integration**
  - Status: Pass 1 - Reviewed existing frontend and backend auth code. Prepared structural notes for integration once backend connectivity is stable.
- [x] **003: Replace Mocked Data with Live Backend Data**
  - Status: Pass 1 - Identified mocked data in Pre-Market (AI briefing, market overview), Market (chart data, AI trade ideas, MentorBull feed, trade journal), Post-Market (AI mentor conversation, recommendations), Education (content list), and Community (posts). Planned general API endpoint structures for each.
- [x] **004: Integrate Live Market Data with Polygon API**
  - Status: Pass 1 - Planned Polygon API integration for live market data (charts, AI analysis). Reviewed API key usage and planned frontend data handling structures. Identified need for backend proxy/service to securely call Polygon API and relay data to frontend.
- [x] **005: Develop Core AI Features for MentorBull**
  - Status: Pass 1 - Defined initial scope for MentorBull AI features: trade idea generation (stocks/options toggle, 0DTE QQQ focus), market commentary (pre-market, in-market, post-market), personalized guidance based on user profile (future), and proactive interaction model. Planned basic logic flow for these features, noting dependencies on live data and user profiles.
- [x] **006: Design & Implement Onboarding Questionnaire**
  - Status: Pass 1 - Designed onboarding questionnaire flow. Drafted questions covering user experience (beginner, intermediate, advanced), trading style (day trader, swing trader, investor), risk tolerance (low, medium, high), financial goals (e.g., income, growth, capital preservation), and preferred securities/markets. Planned data structure for storing responses.
- [x] **007: Build Backend Infrastructure for User Profiles & Preferences**
  - Status: Pass 1 - Designed backend database schema for users, profiles (experience, style, risk, goals, preferred_securities), and questionnaire_responses. Outlined CRUD API endpoints for managing this data (e.g., /api/users/{user_id}/profile, /api/users/{user_id}/questionnaire).
- [x] **008: Design Advanced Mentor AI Interaction Flows**
  - Status: Pass 1 - Outlined advanced interaction flows for MentorBull: proactive check-ins (e.g., "Good morning! Ready to look at pre-market movers?"), personalized feedback on logged trades (e.g., "I noticed you exited that trade quickly, was there a specific signal?"), handling complex queries by breaking them down or asking clarifying questions, and escalating to human support if necessary (future).
